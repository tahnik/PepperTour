# PepperTour
This is a project for Pepper to give a tour of an event or exhibitions. For example, in a museum it can work as a guide to describe different objects or displays.
It asks the user to show the QR code and determines a package based on that. This packages are different paths for the robots. For example, if the user bought animals package it will move the direction where all the animals are displayed.
While moving, it detects QR code that is shown in front of every object. Upon detecting a code it stops and speaks a description for the specific object. Once the users confirm it will start moving again and stop again when it detects another QR.
